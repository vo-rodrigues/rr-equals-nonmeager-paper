# The morphism into the slaloms

This is the explicit Galois–Tukey morphism of Lemma 4.1 in the manuscript.
Its challenge map sends `e` to `e` together with the conditional series selected
from each catalogue indexed by `g`. Its response map records the exceptional
blocks of a growth function and a permutation.
