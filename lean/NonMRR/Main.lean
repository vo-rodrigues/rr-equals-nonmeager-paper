# The uniformity of the meagre ideal is at most the rearrangement number

Both cardinals have their literal definitions: `nonM` uses nonmeagre subsets
of the real line, and `rr` uses rearranging families of permutations of ℕ.
All preceding construction and category lemmas have been proved over mathlib.
